# TicTacToe
A customizable Tic Tac Toe game built using React and Vite.

## Introduction
Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where each player takes turns marking spaces on a grid with their symbol (either X or O). The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

TicTacToe is an implementation of this game using the React framework, built with the Vite build tool, providing a modern and user-friendly interface, with the added flexibility of choosing the grid size (`n` by `n`).

## Features

- Customizable grid size: Choose the size of the grid (`n` by `n`) before starting the game.

- User-friendly interface: The game is displayed in a web page and is easy to use.
